                    I am also familiar with the development of A.I, virtual reality, and many more gameplay systems.
                    I am currently working on a real-time strategy simulation game that heavily relies on an in-game artificial intelligence system additionally a virtual reality god game with a few teammates.
                    All these are being developed for a commercial environment using C# and visual studio 2019 inside of the dot Net framework.
