                <div> I am always learning, and constantly developing my skills, I love programming, developing systems, and creating applications. Most of my knowledge comes from developing projects in my spare time. I am always working on another project in my spare time to both expand my knowledge base and for my own enjoyment. I am knowledgeable about the software development life cycle including agile development processes and industry documentation standards. </div>
